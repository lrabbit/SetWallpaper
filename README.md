This is a win32 tool that allows one to set the desktop background easily when the Desktop tab of the Display control panel has been disabled (or is inexistent). 

I wrote it after being tired to death of having to launch Firefox every monday morning to set the desktop background and replace the one chosen by the management for me (and every one else).
